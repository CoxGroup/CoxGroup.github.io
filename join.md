     <p><strong>Two PhD Positions — Starting October 2026</strong></p>

     <p> Two fully funded 4-year PhD positions are available under the
      supervision of <b>Dr Stephen Cox</b> in the <b>Department of
      Chemistry, Durham University</b>. Recently, and aided by machine
      learning, the <a href="https://coxgroup.github.io/">Cox
      Group</a> has made significant contributions to the development
      of classical density functional theory (neural cDFT) for
      describing complex fluids relevant to chemistry. Examples
      include: </p>


      <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>Bui &amp; Cox, <a
      href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.148001">Phys. Rev. Lett. <b>134</b>,
      148001 (2025)</a>, where we showed how to accurately incorporate
      electrostatic interactions into neural cDFT.</li> 
      </ul>

      <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>Bui &amp; Cox, <a
      href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-648X/ade7e7/pdf">J. Phys.:
      Condens. Matter. <b>37</b>, 285101 (2025)</a>, where we
      developed a rigorous theory describing electromechanics in
      fluids.</li> 
      </ul>

      <ul class="org-ul">      
      <li>Bui &amp; Cox, <a
      href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09855">arxiv:2503.09855</a>
      &#x2014; in press, where we discovered
      <i>dielectrocapillarity</i>, a new phenomenon in which electric
      field gradients influence the adsorption of polar fluids into
      porous media.</li> 
      </ul>

      <ul class="org-ul">      
      <li>Zhou et al., <a
      href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21591">arxiv:2601.21691</a>
      &#x2014; submitted, where we uncovered the thermodynamic driving
      forces governing the selective adsorption of chemical mixtures
      in pores.</li>
      </ul>
      
<p>
Building on these foundations, we now aim to determine the
thermodynamic principles underlying chemical separation and
electromechanical behaviour (i.e., how matter distributes under the
influence of electric fields) at the nanoscale for complex liquid
models relevant to chemistry. This work supports the long-term goal of
establishing design principles for improved nanoscale devices.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Project 1</b> will primarily focus on chemical separation.</li>
<li><b>Project 2</b> will primarily focus on electromechanics.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is significant scope for synergy and overlap between the two
topics. Both projects will provide the opportunity to develop
theoretical and computational skills, including machine learning and
molecular simulations.
</p>

<p>
We strongly encourage applications from students with a solid
background in statistical mechanics, whether from Chemistry, Physics,
Materials Science, or related disciplines. Some experience with
scientific programming (e.g., Python) is helpful. The projects involve
mathematical ideas (e.g., Fourier analysis, variational methods), and
applicants should feel confident in their ability to learn new
mathematical tools as needed, even if they have not formally studied
them before.
</p>

<p>
The studentships cover UK (“home”) fees and a stipend, and include
opportunities to attend international conferences and workshops.
</p>

<p>
Interested students should contact Stephen Cox
(stephen.j.cox@durham.ac.uk) with:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A brief personal statement outlining your previous research
experience, relevant skills for the project(s), and your personal
goals for a PhD.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A CV including performance in relevant university courses, any
prizes or scholarships, and any scientific publications (if
applicable).</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Names and email addresses of two academic or professional referees.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Informal enquiries are also welcome and can be directed to
stephen.j.cox@durham.ac.uk.

     <p><strong>Postdoctoral Research Opportunities</strong></p>

     <p> Postdoctoral positions will be advertised when funding becomes
     available.  We are also keen to support applications for independent
     fellowships (such as <a
     href="https://royalcommission1851.org/fellowships/research-fellowships"
     target="_blank">1851 Research Fellowships</a> or <a
     href="https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/"
     target="_blank">Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowships</a>).  If you are
     interested in joining the group through one of these routes, please
     contact Steve to discuss potential projects.  </p>
