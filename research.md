<h1>Accurately predicting emergent properties of fluids</h1>

<div class="homepage-text">

  <p>
    A key interest of the Cox Group is to understand
    <span>&#8212;</span> armed only with knowledge of the
    interactions between particles <span>&#8212;</span> what
    properties emerge on large length scales. This is especially
    challenging when characteristic length scales of microscopic
    correlations compete with the geometry imposed on the system
    <span>&#8212;</span> a prominent example is confinement in
    nanoporous media.

    We have recently developed

       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      a first-principles theory of electromechanics in fluids
    </a>
    rooted in hyper-density functional theory. Using machine learning
    methods, we can use this theory to investigate polar fluids such
    as water <span>&#8212;</span> we recently discovered
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09855"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      a new phenomenon we dub “dielectrocapillarity”</a>,
    which describes how electric field gradients influence adsorption
    into porous materials. These results build on

      a significant development from our group
    </a>
    concerning how to accurately account for nonlocal correlations
    arising from electrostatic interactions.

      perfect example of electromechanics! <b>Right:</b> Electric
      fields can also be used to control adsorption into pores. In the
      top panel, turning on a field makes it easier for the fluid to
      enter the pore. In the bottom panel, we see that the electric
      field can act as a switch between empty and filled states.</em>

<h1>Crystals in solution: Surface structure and morphology</h1>

<div class="homepage-text">

  <p>
    Our research also extends beyond the behavior of liquids to explore
    how the surrounding fluid environment influences solid surfaces.
    In particular, we are interested in polar crystal surfaces and in
    modelling crystal growth from microscopic principles.
  </p>

  <p> Understanding these processes is key to controlling crystal
    morphology and interfacial structure <span>&#8212;</span> insights
    that are crucial for applications ranging from energy storage
    materials, biomineralization, and catalysis.

  <p> We have shown <a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how the aqueous
  environment can stabilise the polar surface of AgI</a>, and the
  impact this has on its ice-nucleating capability. We also
  demonstrated <a
