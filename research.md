<h1>Accurately predicting emergent properties of fluids</h1>

<div class="homepage-text">

  <p>
    A key interest of the Cox Group is to understand
    <span>&#8212;</span> armed only with knowledge of the
    interactions between particles <span>&#8212;</span> what
    properties emerge on large length scales. This is especially
    challenging when characteristic length scales of microscopic
    correlations compete with the geometry imposed on the system
    <span>&#8212;</span> a prominent example is confinement in
    nanoporous media.

    We have recently developed

       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      a first-principles theory of electromechanics in fluids
    </a>
    rooted in hyper-density functional theory. Using machine learning
    methods, we can use this theory to investigate polar fluids such
    as water <span>&#8212;</span> we recently discovered
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09855"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      a new phenomenon we dub “dielectrocapillarity”</a>,
    which describes how electric field gradients influence adsorption
    into porous materials. These results build on

       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      a significant development from our group
    </a>
    concerning how to accurately account for nonlocal correlations
    arising from electrostatic interactions.

        a response in the number density <span>&#8212;</span> a perfect
        example of electromechanics! <b>Right:</b> Electric fields can
        also be used to control adsorption into pores. In the top

        enter the pore.
