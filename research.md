In the Cox Group, we use theory and molecular simulations to understand the properties of liquids and liquid-solid interfaces. Our focus is on understanding emergent phenomena: How do properties at the microscopic scale impact phenomena on the meso- and macro scales? Individual research topics fall broadly within the following themes:

Crystal-liquid interfaces play important roles in many families of chemical processes, including catalytic reactions of the crystal surface, heterogeneous nucleation at the interface, and crystal growth/dissolution affecting crystal habit. While the possibilities of such interfaces are endless, many are linked by large systems required to accurately probe properties, and the large timescales under which transitions take place.

Here, we are interested in probing the interactions of several crystal interfaces with water. Two such examples are K-feldspar (Fiona) and silver iodide (John). Both materials are known for their ice nucleating properties, and in both cases current molecular models fall short of accurately capturing these properties to an ab initio level. We aim to use machine learned interatomic potentials to explore how the ice nucleating properties of these materials manifest on an atomic level.
Another system of interest sodium chloride, where John is investigating the mechanisms behind growth of polar surfaces. Here, we look to probe how such faces are stabilised during the growth phase and explore how we might tune this growth to create different macroscopic crystal habits.

Understanding the stabilisation of different crystal interfaces, and the dynamics of the crystal-water contact layer, remains necessary to agree simulation with experiment. In this work, we are finding exciting ways to predict macroscopic properties from simulations at the nanoscale, and finding ways to utilise machine learned interatomic potentials in systems dominated by strong electrostatic interactions.

Many of the most fundamental challenges in chemical, biological, and physical sciences involve phenomena that span both atomic and mesoscopic scales. Examples include solvation, electrochemical processes, and the phase behaviour of complex mixtures. Traditional approaches to these problems often face two major limitations: the restricted length scales of molecular simulations and the lack of accuracy in continuum models.
Classical density functional theory (cDFT) offers a powerful statistical mechanical framework for efficiently calculating the structural and thermodynamic properties of liquids at equilibrium. Although the principles underlying cDFT have been known for a long time, its application to complex fluids such as water, electrolytes, polymers, and molecular gases has remained limited.

Areas of current interest include:

• Solvation phenomena

• Electrochemical processes

• Phase behaviour of mixtures

Through these efforts, we aim to address longstanding challenges in multiscale modeling and open new frontiers in understanding and predicting complex physical behaviours.

As the world moves towards the decarbonisation of its electrical supply there is a significant demand for high-performance electrochemical energy storage. In order to maximise the storage capabilities of these devices a thorough theoretical understanding of the static and dynamical molecular-level behaviours that govern system efficiency is required. Understanding the molecular origins of experimental measurables such as system capacitance, rate of charging and discharging, frequency-dependent impedance, and interfacial friction, and how they are impacted by changes in electrode/electrolyte composition will allow for a more theory-driven approach to the design of electrochemical and nanofluidic devices!

We aim to use both classical molecular dynamics and multiscale modelling to deepen our understanding of the microscopic and mesoscopic interactions occurring at electrochemical interfaces and the pronounced impact this behaviour has on macroscopic observables.

Current research in the group focuses on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a widely used experimental analysis tool. An impedance spectrum contains a wealth of important information regarding the electrochemical performance of a device, however it is often unclear how to disentangle the molecular origins of the different frequency dependencies observed. We aim to tackle this ambiguity by looking to understand the molecular-level mechanisms of charge transport in both bulk and confined electrolytes that will consequently give rise to resistive, capacitive and inductive behaviours in an electrochemical cell (see impedance of nanocapacitors [1]). By building a model up from a microscopic level we aim to provide a more analytical understanding of these impedance relationships and hence predict how changing system parameters (e.g. electrolyte composition, temperature) impacts the device performance.

We are also looking to understand the molecular origin of specific ion effects on the capacitance of electrochemical devices. Experimental observations show that changes to the ions in an electrolyte (valency, size, etc.) lead to significant changes in the measured capacitance of the system. By using computer simulation on the micro- and mesoscopic scale, we hope to understand the differences in molecular level mechanisms of double layer formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface and how these link to experimental observables such as capacitance.

Another aspect we focus on is on the flow behaviour of the water and electrolytes in nanofluidic devices.  We are interested in the fundamental aspect of connecting microscopic force fluctuations to macroscopic frictional response (see Green-Kubo relation [2]), informing how to extract meaningful response coefficients from our simulations. In addition, we also develop models to describe non-adiabatic coupling between the solid and liquid charge densities (see quantum friction [3]), advancing the field of nanofluidics by offering sustainable solutions to problems in water desalination and energy harvesting.
