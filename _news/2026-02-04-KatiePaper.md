<h1>Katie's paper on selective adsorption live on arXiv</h1>

<div class="homepage-text">

  <p>First and foremost <span>&#8212;</span> well done to Katie for
  writing her <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21591"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first paper</a>!</p>

  <p>In this paper, we show how the hyper‑DFT approach to mean‑field
  theory <a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(see our previous work)</a>
  can be used for a “train once, learn many” strategy, greatly
  simplifying the machine‑learning component of neural cDFT. In
  particular, we demonstrate how the properties of a binary fluid can
  be investigated by learning the free‑energy functional only for a
  repulsive single‑component reference system.</p>

  <p>But this paper is more than a methodological development. We find
  that the presence of an azeotrope in the fluid’s phase diagram
  influences adsorption under thermodynamic conditions far from
  liquid–vapour coexistence. We also show that adsorption is the
  thermodynamic driving force for pore selectivity, and that a
  completely unselective state corresponds to an extremum in the
  surface tension.</p>
