    <p> <em> Alex demonstrating hydrophobcity with ducks!</em>
      </p> </div>


  <p>The talk focused on Alex’s work using classical density
  functional theory to understand hydrophobicity in complex
  geometries. This research has broad relevance, from interpreting
  liquid-state AFM measurements to understanding mechanisms in
  biological systems.</p>
