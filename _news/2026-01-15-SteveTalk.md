  <p>This week, Steve presented the first in a new series of soft matter seminars in Durham. 
    His talk, entitled ‘Toward first-principles modeling of fluids across length scales’, 
    presented insightful research of relevance to soft matter researchers in both the chemistry and physics departments in Durham. </p>

  <p>This new seminar series, titled SoftForm, will run throughout 2026, 
    comprising fortnightly talks presented by a broad range of external 
    and internal speakers. We are grateful to the Royal Society of Chemistry 
    for funding this exciting new opportunity to collaborate and share our research! </p>
