      Fionaâ€™s research aims to shed light on the mechanisms behind ice
      nucleation at feldspar surfaces. To this end, she is employing
      machine-learned interatomic potentials to model feldspar
      interfaces with water and explore their surfaces
      chemistry. Fiona grew up in Vienna, Austria and studied
      Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh and the University of
      Oxford. In her free time, she enjoys swimming, cycling and
      running.
