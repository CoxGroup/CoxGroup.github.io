    <p style="display: flex; align-items: center; text-align: justify;"> Connieâ€™s research focuses on using theory and molecular simulation to investigate electrochemical systems. She is interested in understanding how molecular-level charge transport processes within bulk and confined electrolytes manifest in the macroscopic experimental analysis of these devices. Connie is from Essex in the UK, and completed a Natural Sciences degree at Cambridge in 2023 before starting her PhD. In her spare time she enjoys playing netball and listening to Taylor Swift!</p>
