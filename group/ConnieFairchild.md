    <p> Connieâ€™s research focuses on using theory and molecular
      simulation to investigate electrochemical systems. She is
      interested in understanding how molecular-level charge transport
      processes within bulk and confined electrolytes manifest in the
      macroscopic experimental analysis of these devices. Connie is
      from Essex in the UK, and completed a Natural Sciences degree at
      Cambridge in 2023 before starting her PhD. In her spare time she
      enjoys playing netball and listening to Taylor Swift!
