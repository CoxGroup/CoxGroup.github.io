    <p>John is exploring the mechanisms behind crystal face growth out
       of solution. In particular, he is interested in understanding
       how particle addition to ionic surfaces affects the macroscopic
       morphology, with special attention given to how polar surfaces
       stabilise themselves while growing. John grew up in Birmingham
       before studying Natural Sciences at Cambridge. In his own time,
       John rows for his college and likes to bake.
