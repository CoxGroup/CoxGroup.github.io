    <p style="display: flex; align-items: center; text-align: justify;"> Katie is exploring ways to model fluids with statistical mechanics. Specifically, she is developing classical density functional theory using machine learning to accurately describe these fluids and predict their liquid-gas behaviour. Katie is from Manchester, and is currently studying Natural Sciences (Chemistry and Physics) at Durham University, doing her final year project with the group. In her spare time, she loves to play the guitar and listen to audiobooks.</p>
