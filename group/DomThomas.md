    <p> Dom aims to understand the link between molecular level
      effects and the energy storage ability of electrochemical
      devices. Specifically, he focuses on using computer simulation
      on the micro- and mesoscopic scale to model the effects changes
      in properties such as ion identity and electrolyte composition
      have on macroscopic observables. He is originally from
      Gloucester and after studying Natural Sciences in Cambridge he
      moved to Durham with the group to start his PhD in 2024. Outside
      of work, Dom can usually be found playing badminton!
