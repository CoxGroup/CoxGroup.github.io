    <p style="display: flex; align-items: center; text-align: justify;">Dom aims to understand the link between molecular level effects and the energy storage ability of electrochemical devices. Specifically, he focuses on using computer simulation on the micro- and mesoscopic scale to model the effects changes in properties such as ion identity and electrolyte composition have on macroscopic observables. He is originally from Gloucester and after studying Natural Sciences in Cambridge he moved to Durham with the group to start his PhD in 2024. Outside of work, Dom can usually be found playing badminton!
