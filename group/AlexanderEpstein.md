    <p style="display: flex; align-items: center; text-align: justify;" >Alex works on using statistical mechanical methods to study solvation. He is interested in both improving computational models of solvation and applying these new theories to important problems in chemistry and materials science. Before coming to Cambridge, he studied Materials Science throughout his studies, with a B.S. from the University of Maryland and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. In his PhD he used molecular simulations and quantum chemistry tools to understand the role of polymer chemistry in the monomer-to-monomer recycling of sustainable plastics. Outside of work, he does pottery and loves the outdoors.</p>
