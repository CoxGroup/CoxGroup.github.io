    <p>Alex works on using statistical
    mechanical methods to study solvation. He is interested in both
    improving computational models of solvation and applying these new
    theories to important problems in chemistry and materials
    science. Before coming to Cambridge, he studied Materials Science,
    with a B.S. from the University of Maryland and a Ph.D. from the
    University of California, Berkeley. In his PhD he used molecular
    simulations and quantum chemistry tools to understand the role of
    polymer chemistry in the monomer-to-monomer recycling of
    sustainable plastics. Outside of work, he does pottery and loves
    the outdoors.
