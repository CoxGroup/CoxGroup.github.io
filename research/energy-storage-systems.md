As the world moves towards the decarbonisation of its electrical supply there is a significant demand for high-performance electrochemical energy storage. In order to maximise the storage capabilities of these devices a thorough theoretical understanding of the static and dynamical molecular-level behaviours that govern system efficiency is required. Understanding the molecular origins of experimental measurables such as system capacitance, rate of charging and discharging, frequency-dependent impedance, and interfacial friction, and how they are impacted by changes in electrode/electrolyte composition will allow for a more theory-driven approach to the design of electrochemical and nanofluidic devices!

We aim to use both classical molecular dynamics and multiscale modelling to deepen our understanding of the microscopic and mesoscopic interactions occurring at electrochemical interfaces and the pronounced impact this behaviour has on macroscopic observables.

Current research in the group focuses on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a widely used experimental analysis tool. An impedance spectrum contains a wealth of important information regarding the electrochemical performance of a device, however it is often unclear how to disentangle the molecular origins of the different frequency dependencies observed. We aim to tackle this ambiguity by looking to understand the [molecular-level mechanisms of charge transport](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318157121) in both bulk and confined electrolytes that will consequently give rise to resistive, capacitive and inductive behaviours in an electrochemical cell. By building a model up from a microscopic level we aim to provide a more analytical understanding of these impedance relationships and hence predict how changing system parameters (e.g. electrolyte composition, temperature) impacts the device performance.

We are also looking to understand the molecular origin of specific ion effects on the capacitance of electrochemical devices. Experimental observations show that changes to the ions in an electrolyte (valency, size, etc.) lead to significant changes in the measured capacitance of the system. By using computer simulation on the micro- and mesoscopic scale, we hope to understand the differences in molecular level mechanisms of double layer formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface and how these link to experimental observables such as capacitance.

Another aspect we focus on is on the flow behaviour of the water and electrolytes in nanofluidic devices.  We are interested in the fundamental aspect of [connecting microscopic force fluctuations to macroscopic frictional response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07134v1), informing how to extract meaningful response coefficients from our simulations. In addition, we also develop models to describe [non-adiabatic coupling between the solid and liquid charge densities](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c04187), advancing the field of nanofluidics by offering sustainable solutions to problems in water desalination and energy harvesting.
