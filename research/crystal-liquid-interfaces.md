Crystal-liquid interfaces play important roles in many families of chemical processes, including catalytic reactions of the crystal surface, heterogeneous nucleation at the interface, and crystal growth/dissolution affecting crystal habit. While the possibilities of such interfaces are endless, many are linked by large systems required to accurately probe properties, and the large timescales under which transitions take place.

Here, we are interested in probing the interactions of several crystal interfaces with water. Two such examples are K-feldspar (Fiona) and silver iodide (John). Both materials are known for their ice nucleating properties, and in both cases current molecular models fall short of accurately capturing these properties to an ab initio level. We aim to use machine learned interatomic potentials to explore how the ice nucleating properties of these materials manifest on an atomic level.
Another system of interest sodium chloride, where John is investigating the mechanisms behind growth of polar surfaces. Here, we look to probe how such faces are stabilised during the growth phase and explore how we might tune this growth to create different macroscopic crystal habits.

Understanding the stabilisation of different crystal interfaces, and the dynamics of the crystal-water contact layer, remains necessary to agree simulation with experiment. In this work, we are finding exciting ways to predict macroscopic properties from simulations at the nanoscale, and finding ways to utilise machine learned interatomic potentials in systems dominated by strong electrostatic interactions.
